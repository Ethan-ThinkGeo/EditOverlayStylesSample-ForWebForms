Edit Overlay Styles Sample for WebForms

### Description

This Web project demonstrates how to control the styles of the **EditOverlay**, for both the default style and the editing style. In order to accomplish this, we use javascript code. Look at the code in the *script* tag to see how we can control the fill color, the opacity, the border width, and other attributes of the features in the **EditOverlay**.
